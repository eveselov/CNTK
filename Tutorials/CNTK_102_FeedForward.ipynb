    "# CNTK 102:  Feed Forward Network with Simulated Data\n",
    "\n",
    "The purpose of this tutorial is to familiarize you with quickly combining components from the CNTK python library to perform a **classification** task. You may skip *Introduction* section, if you have already completed the Logistic Regression tutorial or are familiar with machine learning. \n",
    "\n",
    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "**Problem** (recap from the CNTK 101):\n",
    "\n",
    "A cancer hospital has provided data and wants us to determine if a patient has a fatal [malignant][] cancer vs. a benign growth. This is known as a classification problem. To help classify each patient, we are given their age and the size of the tumor. Intuitively, one can imagine that younger patients and/or patient with small tumor size are less likely to have malignant cancer. The data set simulates this application where the each observation is a patient represented as a dot where red color indicates malignant and blue indicates a benign disease. Note: This is a toy example for learning, in real life there are large number of features from different tests/examination sources and doctors'  experience that play into the diagnosis/treatment decision for a patient.\n",

    "<img src=\"https://www.cntk.ai/jup/cancer_data_plot.jpg\", width=400, height=400>\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "**Goal**:\n",
    "Our goal is to learn a classifier that classifies any patient into either benign or malignant category given two features (age, tumor size). \n",
    "\n",
    "In CNTK 101 tutorial, we learnt a linear classifier using Logistic Regression which misclassified some data points. Often in real world problems, linear classifiers cannot accurately model the data in situations where there is little to no knowledge of how to construct good features. This often results in accuracy limitations and requires models that have more complex decision boundaries. In this tutorial, we will combine multiple linear units (from the CNTK 101 tutorial - Logistic Regression) to a non-linear classifier. The other aspect of such classifiers where the feature encoders are automatically learnt from the data will be covered in later tutorials.  \n",
    "\n",
    "**Approach**:\n",
    "Any learning algorithm has typically five stages. These are Data reading, Data preprocessing, Creating a model, Learning the model parameters, and Evaluating (a.k.a. testing/prediction) the model. \n",
    "\n",
    "We keep everything same as CNTK 101 except for the third (Model creation) step where we use a feed forward network instead.\n",
    " \n",
    "\n",
    "## Feed forward network model\n",
    "\n",
    "The data set used is similar to the one used in the Logistic Regression tutorial. The model combines multiple logistic classifiers to be able to classify data when the decision boundary needed to properly categorize the data is more complex than a simple linear model (like Logistic Regression). The figure below illustrates the general shape of the network.\n",

    "<img src=\"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/5/54/Feed_forward_neural_net.gif\",width=200, height=200> \n",

    "A feedforward neural network is an artificial neural network where connections between the units **do not** form a cycle.\n",
    "The feedforward neural network was the first and simplest type of artificial neural network devised. In this network, the information moves in only one direction, forward, from the input nodes, through the hidden nodes (if any) and to the output nodes. There are no cycles or loops in the network\n",

For this toy example it is not a big deal. However with real world example, making multiple passes over the entire data set for each iteration of parameter update becomes computationally prohibitive. \n",
